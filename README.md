1. What aspect of the work have correctly been implemented and what have not?
	-All my files are named index.html resume.html and bio.html and they are all in the directory zfoste01.github.io
	-I used at least 5 rules in one of my CSS files.
	-All of my pages pass the official HTML5 specs and CSS validation.
	-I have an index.html page hosted in my Tufts CS account
	-I have a README.md file that briefly descibes my work.
	-I tried to commit with meaningful messages but for the start of the project I was having trouble understanding Git. I didn't start using it more consistently until the last day that I was working on the assignment.

2. I discussed the assignment with two TAs, Michael D and Phil W.
3. I think I spent around 10 hours on this assignment over the course of about 5 days.
